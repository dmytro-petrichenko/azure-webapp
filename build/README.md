# Nuke build scripts

The bootstrap scripts now live in this `build/` folder to keep the repository root clean.

## Run from the repository root

```bash
./build/build.sh [target]
```

```powershell
./build/build.ps1 [target]
```

```cmd
build\build.cmd [target]
```

## Run from the build folder

```bash
cd build
./build.sh [target]
```

```powershell
cd build
./build.ps1 [target]
```

```cmd
cd build
build.cmd [target]
```
